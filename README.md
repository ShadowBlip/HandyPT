# HandyPT

This is a [Crankshaft](https://crankshaft.space/) plugin that provides control over various power settings such as TDP in handheld devices in Linux. We utilize the [RyzenAdj](https://github.com/FlyGoat/RyzenAdj) utility to interface with the hardware. 

## What does it do?

- Set GPU power parameters (TDP, Boost TDP)
- Display supplementary battery and system power use info.
- More to come! Follow us for new features and improvements.

## What does it look like?

## Which devices does this support?

We currently support devices with the following APU's:
- 4500U, 4800U, 5700U, 5800U, and 5825U

While any APU can theoretcally be utilized, the safe operating limits need to be defined before support can be included. If you dont see you device listed head over to our [issues page](https://github.com/ShadowBlip/HandyPT/issues) to request support.


## What distributions of Linus are supported?

We test each release on ChimeraOS and HoloISO. Any distro that supports flatpak, gamescope, and wayland should be able to use this with the DeckUI. Head over to the [issues page](https://github.com/ShadowBlip/HandyPT/issues) if your distro has issues and we'll work to get more broad support.
